# This program cleans data for DEFN

# The program is written by Iris Arbogast (irisarbogast@gmail.com) 
# Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, April 2, 2021
# The program is translated from Stata code from Mahdi Ebsim
# The code uses state-level GDP data from the BEA and Defense Wages/Contracts 
# from Dupor and Guerrero (2017)

# ------------------------- Setup ----------------------------------
# Note that I'm using this ----- "text" ---- format because a) it looks nice 
# and b) it creates an outline of the code in R-studio down at the bottom.

# If these libraries are not already installed, uncomment these lines and run once
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("haven")
# install.packages("cdlTools")
# install.packages("readxl")


library(tidyverse) #This package reads data wrangling packages, string parsing, graphing (dplyr)
library(haven) #This package allows R to read in .dta files
library(cdlTools) #This package has fips -> state code functions
library(readxl) #This package allows reading in excel files

# A main feature of the package are the pipes (%>%) that pass a data frame from one
# function to another. Here, we just take the dataset and send it using pipes
